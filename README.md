=============

Common code for the Relational Databases and Full Stack Fundamentals courses

to clone repo as 'fullstack'
`git clone https://github.com/sfortunato/fullstack-nanodegree-vm.git fullstack`

need to install:
- git (duh)
- Virtual Box
- Vagrant

to launch vm:
- cd to `fullstack/vagrant` then `vagrant up`
- once up, `vagrant ssh`
- to log out `exit`
- to turn off VM `vagrant halt` (requires vagrant up to restart)

Ensure that you're in vagrant directory before adding/editing/deleting (one folder down from README, no need to go into deeper vagrant dirs)
